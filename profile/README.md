## About

The FireBIM platform relies on Building Information Modelling (BIM), Open Data standards, semantic data modelling, and web technologies specifically addressing international collaboration and computational interoperability.
It resembles an interpreter, inspector, and validator of the regulations, thus also helping authorities facilitate and regulate fire safety more efficiently.
Using FireBIM, design teams will be digitally assisted to create safer and better buildings cost-effectively.
The FireBIM platform will purposefully be open source, providing the infrastructure for developers to bring the FireBIM concept to new countries and applications.

FireBIM gathers 22 partners from 5 countries committed to enabling fire safety engineering with faster, more precise, user-centred applications while supporting integration with other AEC standards and tools.
The novel FireBIM technology stack will provide the most effective measures for minimising human risk as early as the building design process.
